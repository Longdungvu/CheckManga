A simple web scraper that can scrape manga hosting websites to see if any of the manga I've been reading has been updated. Stores data on each title, manga hosting website, and how to scrape each site in a database. Database updates itself whenever the web scraper finds a new chapter has been released. Working on implementing a new "bookmarking" feature that will let me keep track of new manga I start reading where I am not yet caught up to the most recent chapter or where the series has been completed.

A simple web scraper script that checks manga sites to see if any of the manga I've been reading has been updated. Also generates a database of the manga I'm reading and updates itself whenever the web scraper finds a new chapter has been released.

Useful additions:

-A 'completed manga' table or db to move any completed series to.

-Being able to update, delete, or add entries in bulk rather than just one by one or being able to update, delete, or add based on a json or text file.

-Generating a table or db from a json file or text file of information about the manga.

-Support for multiple websites or removing dependence on one particular site since sometimes a series will be unavailable on certain sites.

-Being able to indicate whether you've read the manga that has the most recent chapter released or not.

-Being able to "bookmark" your most recent chapter read for a manga that is either completed or that you just started and haven't caught up to the latest chapter released.
