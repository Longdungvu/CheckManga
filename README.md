CheckManga
==========

A simple web scraper script that checks manga sites to see if any of the manga I've been reading has been updated. Also generates a database of the manga I'm reading and updates itself whenever the web scraper finds a new chapter has been released.

Notes for improvement:
-A 'completed manga' table or db to move any completed series to.
-Being able to update, delete, or add entries in bulk rather than just one by one or being able to update, delete, or add based on a json or text file.
-Generating a table or db from a json file or text file of information about the manga
-Support for multiple websites or removing dependence on one particular site since sometimes a series will be unavailable on certain sites.
-Being able to indicate whether you've read the manga that has the most recent chapter released or not.
-Being able to "bookmark" your most recent chapter read for a manga that is either completed or that you just started and haven't caught up to the latest chapter released.
