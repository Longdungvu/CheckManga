CheckManga
==========

A simple web scraper that can scrape manga hosting websites to see if any of the manga I've been reading has been updated. Stores data on each title, manga hosting website, and how to scrape each site in a database. Database updates itself whenever the web scraper finds a new chapter has been released. Working on implementing a new "bookmarking" feature that will let me keep track of new manga I start reading where I am not yet caught up to the most recent chapter or where the series has been completed.
